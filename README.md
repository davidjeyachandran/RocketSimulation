# Rocket Simulation

I have three kids who are really interested in rockets and space. To understand some basic physics we created a rocket, propelled by rubberbands. 

We measured the flight time and then calculated the approximate launch velocity and the maximum altitude. The kids weren't too interested in the mathematics but they helped me in the multiplication, division and addition.

Reload the page and click on the "Launch" button.

We recorded a maximum flight time of 7.3 seconds. Run the progam using default values to see the maximum height.

I also created this simple simulation to model the flight of the rocket.
